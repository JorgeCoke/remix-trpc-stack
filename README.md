# ðŸ’¿ Remix + tRPC experimental stack [Lab ðŸ§ª]

End-to-end type safety from Remix is already present with its Loaders/Actions. What if we could replace them with tRPC calls?

## What's included?

- Remix: https://remix.run/
- tRPC: https://trpc.io/
- ReactQuery tRPC: https://trpc.io/docs/client/react

## Goals/Features

- Serve tRPC client from Remix Server side
- Do not use Remix Loaders/Actions, use tRPC calls instead
- Get e2e type safety
- Include "Vanilla tRPC" + "ReactQuery tRPC" usage

### Set up

```
npm ci                          # Install dependencies
npm run dev                     # Launch project locally
```
